# NatureNiners
Nature Niners is a network connecting people belonging to all the age groups to nature to raise awareness. The registered users can explore, propose action ideas, like and comment on any action and contribute to those actions. The actions will be implemented as real-time events based on the user votes for that particular idea. Our app also sends out News Letters that contains newly added actions to all the registered users based on their subscription type. All these features are developed to enhance user engagement.
